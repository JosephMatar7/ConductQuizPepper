Explanation

1. Introduction:
Pepper informs the applicant about a small quiz. The applicant can choose to accept or decline.


2. Quiz Interaction:

If the applicant agrees, the quiz begins on the tablet screen.

Applicants can respond to questions either:

By Speech: Speaking the correct answer or the number corresponding to it.

By Tablet: Clicking the correct answer directly on the screen.




3. Feedback:

Pepper evaluates the response and provides feedback:

Announces whether the answer is correct or not.

Shows an animation for interactive engagement.

Highlights the selected answer in green (if correct) or red (if incorrect) on the screen.




4. Progression:

After each answer, Pepper automatically moves to the next question.

The quiz consists of 3 questions and has a time limit of 3 minutes.



5. Timeout:

If the applicant does not answer all questions within 3 minutes, the quiz ends automatically.


6. End:

At the end of the quiz, Pepper informs the applicant that the quiz is finished and shows him his score.
