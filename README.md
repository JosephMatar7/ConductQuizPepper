Explanation: The robot first informs the applicant about a small quiz. The person can agree to take the quiz or not. If the applicant agrees to take the quiz
  pepper starts the quiz on screen (tablet). The person taking the quiz can either answer by speech (telling pepper the correct answer or the number of the correct
  answer) or by clicking the correct answer on screen. After giving the answer to pepper by speech or by clicking, pepper will then inform the applicant if his answer
  is correct or not, along with an interactive animation from the robot. Additionally, the answer on screen will turn red or green if clicked depending if its correct 
  or not. After answering a question either on screen or by speech, pepper automatically switches to a different question. The quiz consists of 3 questions and has 
  a timer of 3 minutes. If the applicant exceeds 3 minutes without answering all the questions, the quiz will automatically end.
